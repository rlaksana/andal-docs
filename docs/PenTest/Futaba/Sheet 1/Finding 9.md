### Comprehensive Analysis of TLS Version 1.1 Deprecated Protocol Vulnerability

#### Overview

The use of **TLS (Transport Layer Security) version 1.1** has become a significant concern in cybersecurity due to its outdated nature and inherent vulnerabilities. This analysis explores the implications of continuing to support TLS 1.1, the severity of its vulnerabilities, and strategic recommendations for remediation.

#### Vulnerability Assessment

- **Vulnerability Identification**: The server's use of TLS 1.1 is classified as a vulnerability due to its deprecation by major standards and security agencies, including NIST and PCI-DSS. TLS 1.1 was officially deprecated as of March 2021, marking it as an insecure protocol that is no longer suitable for protecting sensitive data transmissions[6][7].

- **Severity Rating**: The vulnerability is rated as **MEDIUM** with a **CVSS Score of 6.5**. This score reflects the potential impact and exploitability of the vulnerability, indicating that while it poses a risk, it may not be the highest priority compared to other critical vulnerabilities[2][4].

- **Description of Risks**: TLS 1.1 is susceptible to various attacks such as POODLE and BEAST, which can compromise data integrity and confidentiality. These attacks exploit weaknesses in the protocol's design, particularly in how it handles encryption and session management[5][8].

#### Contextual Understanding

- **Industry Standards and Compliance**: The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) mandates the use of secure encryption protocols for safeguarding payment data. As of June 30, 2018, organizations were required to disable TLS 1.0 and implement TLS 1.2 or higher to comply with these standards[6]. The continued support for TLS 1.1 not only jeopardizes security but also risks non-compliance with industry regulations.

- **Browser Support**: Major web browsers have ceased support for TLS 1.1 since 2020, further emphasizing the need for organizations to upgrade their systems to maintain accessibility and security[3][5]. Websites still using this protocol may become inaccessible to users relying on modern browsers.

#### Strategic Evaluation and Recommendations

- **Immediate Remediation Steps**:
  - **Disable TLS 1.1**: Organizations should immediately disable TLS 1.1 on their servers to mitigate associated risks.
  - **Enable TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3**: Transitioning to TLS 1.2 or the more secure TLS 1.3 is essential for enhancing security measures against evolving threats[2][4].

- **Technical Implementation**:
  - For web servers such as Apache or Nginx, administrators should modify their SSL configuration files to exclude TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 from supported protocols:
    ```apache
    SSLProtocol -all -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1 +TLSv1.2 +TLSv1.3
    ```
    ```nginx
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ```
    Restarting the server will be necessary for changes to take effect[3][4].

- **Long-term Strategy**: Organizations should adopt a proactive approach by regularly reviewing their security protocols and compliance with industry standards, ensuring that they are prepared for future developments in encryption technology.

### Conclusion

The continued use of TLS version 1.1 poses significant risks due to its outdated security features and lack of support from modern browsers and regulatory bodies. By disabling this protocol and transitioning to more secure versions like TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3, organizations can significantly enhance their cybersecurity posture while ensuring compliance with industry standards. The analysis underscores the importance of staying current with technological advancements in encryption protocols to safeguard sensitive information effectively.
