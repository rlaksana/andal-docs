Finding 10 highlights a **vulnerability** related to SSL certificates, specifically the issue of a **wrong hostname**. This vulnerability is categorized with a **medium severity** and assigned a **CVSS score of 5.3**, indicating a moderate level of risk.

## Vulnerability Overview

### Description
The vulnerability arises when the SSL certificate presented by a server does not match the server's hostname. This mismatch can lead to significant security concerns, as it may signal potential man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks where an attacker could intercept or manipulate communications between the user and the server.

### Common Causes
1. **Certificate Configuration Errors**: The most frequent cause of this issue is improper configuration during the issuance of the SSL certificate. For instance, if the common name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) does not include the exact hostname being accessed, browsers will flag this as an error[1][2].
2. **Self-Signed Certificates**: Using self-signed certificates without proper hostname validation can also lead to this mismatch. Such certificates often lack the necessary trust from browsers, resulting in warnings for users[2][5].
3. **NAT Settings Misconfiguration**: In some cases, network address translation (NAT) settings may not align with the hostname in the SSL certificate, causing discrepancies that trigger error messages during secure connections[5].

## Impact
The implications of this vulnerability are significant:
- **User Distrust**: When users encounter warnings about SSL mismatches, they may choose not to proceed to the website, leading to potential loss of traffic and customers[1].
- **Security Risks**: The presence of a mismatch can indicate that unauthorized parties may be attempting to intercept data, which can have serious ramifications for data integrity and confidentiality[2][4].

## Recommended Solutions
To mitigate this vulnerability, organizations should take the following steps:
1. **Obtain Proper SSL Certificates**: Ensure that SSL certificates are issued with the correct CN and SAN values that match all intended hostnames. This includes both www and non-www versions of domain names[2][6].
2. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of SSL configurations using tools like SSL checkers to identify and rectify any mismatches promptly[1][3].
3. **Educate Users**: Inform users about potential security warnings and encourage them to verify certificate details before proceeding with sensitive transactions[4][6].

In summary, addressing the SSL certificate hostname mismatch is crucial for maintaining user trust and ensuring secure communications on the web. Proper configuration and regular maintenance are key strategies in preventing such vulnerabilities from impacting an organizationâ€™s online presence.
